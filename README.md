### Abstract ###

The purpose of the Electricity Billing System is to automate the existing manual system with the help of computerized equipment and fullfiedged computer software ,fullfilling their reqirements ,so that their valuable data information can be stored for a long period with easy acess and amnipilation of the same.the reqired software and hardware are easily avaialable and easy to work with electricity billing system as described above can lead to an errorforce ,secure,reliable and fast management system.
It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather to concentrate on the record keeping.that it will help organization in better utilization of resoureces.The organization can maintain Computerized records without redundant entries.that means that one need not to be distracted by information that is not relevant while being able to reach the information.
the aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of computerized equipments and ful-fiedged computer ,software,fulfilling their reqirements ,so that their valuable data information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation the same.Basically the project describes how to manage for good performance and better services for the clients.
